I thought through many ideas for my game, and one major challenge I have is how to make it simple but also contains a story. 






Here us just a draft of the story:

Once upon a time, there is a boy who existed alone. He is special because his soul can talk to his body. Perhaps he could do this because he was so lonely. 

One day, right hand said to him, “I want to feel the world.. it is ok if I leave you for a bit?”

He felt sad and said, “leave…do you not love me anymore ?”

Right hand said “No!! I love you! But I just wanted to adventure”

He said, “but, my left hand don’t need adventures, my eyes, ears, nose don’t need adventures. Why do you need? Is my love not enough?

“no… I jus-”

If you love me you will stay” 



leave/stay

-(if stayed, the story plays from “a long time passed, one day, right hand said….”

Another day, right feet said to him, “I want to travel the world..it is ok if I leave you for a bit?”

“… If you love me you will stay” He said again.

“will you not love me if I leave?” Asked left leg

“maybe, it is hard to love you if you leave. At least I won’t love you as much as my right leg for sure”

“…why?”

“because love is equivalent exchange, my leg. It’s not unconditional. How can you love someone who doesn’t love you back.”

“They just have other stuff they want to do. I’m sure they still love you. ”

“well that is simply not true.”

“well I know that I will love you even if I am not with you or think of you all the time”

“that is not true.”

leave/leave

-(if stayed, the story plays from “a long time passed, one day, left leg said….”

*** the deity is now laying on the ground, his body parts are missing everywhere***

Another day, heart said “hey”

He said “are you also going to leave me?”

Heart said “ I am thinking about it… I am curious what the world feels like too. 

“are you going to leave me too?”

“I will stay only if you love me, but I don’t feel love in you anymore”

“Its them, they all left me, and they look my love away”

“well maybe you shouldn’t stop loving them”

“theres no unconditional love, heart.”

“yeah, there is no unconditional love…Good bye, boy.”
