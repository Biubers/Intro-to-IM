My intentions for this assignment is to recreate the tiktok trend: "Two freinds in the room...Will they kiss?...Yes they will!~" trend but in more creative ways. Hence, I used the template that we went through in class as template and started from there.


Challenges: 

At first, I my words would not be in the right place. I checked the code many times but its seems like everything was fine, hence, the code should work properly. After looking for help from some IM major freinds, I realized it was a problem on the CSV side. The code reads the text in CVS vertically, but I have my words in horizontal order, hence the output that I get is all over the place. After changing the order of my text from vertical to horizontal, I got the results that I wanted. 

Another Challenge that I faced is that there is alwasy a " sign in front of my first generated word. I have tried for a long time to see why it was there but I still dont know why.
