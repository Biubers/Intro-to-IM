My intentions for this assignment is to recreate the tiktok trend: "Two freinds in the room...Will they kiss?...Yes they will!~" trend but in more creative ways. Hence, I used the template that we went through in class as template and started from there. 
Challenges: At first, I my words would not be in the right place. I checked the code many times but its seems like everything was fine, hence, the code should work properly. After looking for help from IM major freinds, I realized it was a problem on the CSV side.
