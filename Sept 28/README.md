My intentions for this assignment is to recreate the tiktok trend: "Two freinds in the room...Will they kiss?...Yes they will!~" trend but in more creative ways. Hence, I used the template that we went through in class as template and started from there.


Challenges: 

At first, I my words would not be in the right place. I checked the code many times but its seems like everything was fine, hence, the code should work properly. After looking for help from some IM major freinds, I realized it was a problem on the CSV side. The code reads the text in CVS vertically, but I have my words in horizontal order, hence the output that I get is all over the place. After changing the order of my text from vertical to horizontal, I got the results that I wanted. However, I am curious to why the program reads properly in the sample poem in out notes even when the CSV file have the list typed in horizontally in groups. (and why it reads vertically in my own project)

Here is a screenshotafter I changed the list to support the program reading veertically.

Another Challenge that I faced is that there is alwasy a " sign in front of my first generated word. I have tried for a long time to see why it was there but I still dont know why. I definitely didn't type in an extra " and there wasn't a problem with my code that I could identify.
